Students were provided a existing code which included index.html, style.css and images for the site and the objective for the homework was introduce or imporve the code as follows;

- **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. This is a common task for front-end and junior developers.

- **Accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
